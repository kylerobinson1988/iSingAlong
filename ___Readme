# Ai!SingAlong

This app was my original idea for a final project (before I joined the group making Setup.)  Incorporates Parse framework and Crashlytics.  Written in Swift.

This app is like a miniaturized version of slide projection software like ProPresenter.  It's designed to be used with live music and allows you to create a Session of songs.  Songs can be added from an API, or typed out manually.  

Songs can be split into blocks for Presentation mode, where the person running the Session can display a certain block of text at a time.  Or all the lyrics can be displayed at once.  

A Session can be saved with or without a password.  No other registration or login required!  Anyone can find a session in Search.  

This app features a lot of custom drawing, table views with reusable cells, and content generated based on searches, as well as multi-peer connectivity in Presentation mode.
